fabric-virtualenv - Fabric functions for working with remote virtualenvs
========================================================================

fabric-virtualenv provides Fabric functions for creating virtualenvs on remote
servers, as well as installing packages to them, and running other Fabric
operations in the context of the virtualenv.

``fabvenv.virtualenv(path)``

    A context manager that performs all nested operations in the context of the
    virtualenv `path`.

    For example::

        >>> from fabvenv import virtualenv
        >>> with virtualenv('/home/me/venv/'):
        ...     run('python foo')

    It is highly recommended to use an absolute path, as Fabric's ``cd()``
    contextmanager is always applied BEFORE ``virtualenv()``, regardless of how
    they are nested.

``fabvenv.make_virtualenv(path, dependencies=[], eggs=[], system_site_packages=True)``

    Create or update a virtualenv in path, installing the given packages and eggs.

    * ``path`` - The path to the virtualenv. This path will be created if it
        does not already exist.
    * ``dependencies`` - a list of paths or URLs to Python packages to install
        with ``pip``.
    * ``eggs`` - a list of paths or URLs to eggs to install with
        ``easy_install``. Eggs can be used to speed up deployments that require
        libraries to be compiled.
    * ``system_site_packages`` - If True, the newly-created virtualenv will
        expose the system site package. If False, these will be hidden.

``fabvenv.prepare_virtualenv()``

    Ensure a version of the ``virtualenv`` command is available on the remote
    server. If none exists, a standalone virtualenv.py script will be
    downloaded from the virtualenv github and saved as ``~/virtualenv.py``.

    The virtualenv command that is prepared is available as ``env.virtualenv``.


Changelog
---------

* **0.2.1** - Fix bug in make_virtualenv with virtualenv.py installed by prepare_virtualenv.

* **0.2.0** - make_virtualenv now updates ``system_site_packages`` flag on
  previously-created virtualenvs.
